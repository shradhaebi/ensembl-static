### Annotation

Gene annotation was provided by the https://valleyoak.ucla.edu 
...
details here, example http://plants.ensembl.org/Coffea_canephora/Info/Annotation/
...

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). 
There are: 2,312,761 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 74 Mb 
(8.8% of the genome); 231,802 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants 
library), covering 87 Mb (10.2% of the genome); 752,294 Tandem repeats 
(TRF) features, covering 99 Mb (11.6% of the genome).
