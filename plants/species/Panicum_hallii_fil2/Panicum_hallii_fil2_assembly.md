### Assembly

Two genotypes of *Panicum hallii* were sequenced using a whole genome
shotgun strategy at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (USA) and the
HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (USA). Sequencing effort for
HAL2 included one Illumina 800 bp insert 2 × 250 fragment library
(150 × ) and a total of 89.5x of PACBIO reads (average subread length
11.8 kb). FIL2 sequencing was similar, with one Illiumina 500 bp insert
2 × 150 fragment library (100 × ) and a total of 95.87x of PACBIO reads
(average subread length 9.6 kb). Assembly was performed with MECAT and
polished using QUIVER. A 325,613-marker genetic map from shallow
resequencing of a RIL population was used to identify and correct
mis-joins in the assemblies.
