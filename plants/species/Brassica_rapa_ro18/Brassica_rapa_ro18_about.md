About *Brassica rapa*
---------------------

*Brassica rapa* is widely cultivated as leafy and root vegetables as well as an oilseed and condiment, with
different subspecies having distinct morphotypes producing turnips (roots), bok and pak choi, choi sum, Chinese
cabbage, broccoletto, turnip, oilseed rape, as well as field and yellow mustard.
This genome corresponds to the diploid (AA, 2n=20) genotype R-o-18,
an inbred line of the mustard crop yellow sarson (*B. rapa* subsp. *trilocularis*: NCBI:txid1813537), 
which has been used to produce a TILLING population for reverse genetics studies (doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-10-62).
