In June 2023, Ensembl Bacteria released new gene predictions for almost all of the genomes it hosts. This was done in collaboration with the EMBL-EBI metagenomics team and utlised a pipeline using [Prokka](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153), combined with results from [cmscan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/rna/infernal_cmscan/), [EggNOG](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1085) and [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about/interproscan/). We have retained the community-submitted annotation for 115 species that are in our pan-taxonomic comparative analysis.

- Genomes

	- A total of 31,332 [non-redundant](https://www.ensembl.info/2020/09/21/ensembl-bacteria-updates/) bacterial and archaeal genomes

- Data 

	- New gene predictions for genomes (except for 115 species in pan-taxonomic compara)
	- Updated annotation of molecular interactions involving bacterial genes 
	- Alignments to [Rfam](https://rfam.xfam.org) covariance models (Rfam 12.2) visible in separate track (‘Rfam models’)
	- Updated protein features for all species using [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/)
	- Updated pan-taxonomic compara (which includes key bacterial species)
