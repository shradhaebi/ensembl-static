## Ensembl Bacteria

Ensembl Bacteria is a browser for bacterial and archaeal genomes. These are taken from the databases of the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration](http://www.insdc.org/), the European Nucleotide Archive at the EBI, GenBank at the NCBI, and the DNA Database of Japan).

### Non-redundant genomes

As of release 35 (April 2017), we have only integrated new sequences that are non-redundant when compared to the existing data set, according to the [criteria of the UniProt Knowledgebase](http://http://insideuniprot.blogspot.co.uk/2015_05_01_archive.html) (DOI: [10.1093/database/baw139](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5199198/)). From summer 2020 (release 49), we will only be hosting non-redundant prokaryotic genomes. All existing data will be continue to be available via the archive sites.

### Data access

Data can be visualised through the Ensembl genome browser and accessed programmatically via our Perl and RESTful APIs. Data is also accessible through public MySQL databases and our FTP site containing full data dumps in FASTA, EMBL, GTF, GFF3, JSON and RDF formats. A selection of over 100 key bacterial genomes have been included in the pan-taxonomic compara, and genes from all genomes have been classified into families using HAMAP and PANTHER [more details](/info/docs/compara/index.html).
