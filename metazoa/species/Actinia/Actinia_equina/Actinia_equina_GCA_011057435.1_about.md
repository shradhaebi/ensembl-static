About *Actinia equina*
------------------------

_Actinia equina_
The beadlet anemone (_Actinia equina (L.)_) is one of the most familiar organisms of the North European intertidal zone. Once considered a single, morphologically variable species across northern Europe, it is now recognised as one member of a variable species complex.[1]
Its range extends to the Mediterranean Sea, and along the Atlantic coast of Africa as far south as South Africa. _Actinia equina_ can be found both in exposed and sheltered situations. It is highly adapted to the intertidal zone as it can tolerate both high temperatures and desiccation.[2]
