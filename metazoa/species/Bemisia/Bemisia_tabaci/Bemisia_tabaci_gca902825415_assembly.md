**Assembly**
------------------------
The *Bemisia tabaci* SSA1-SG1 Uganda genome was produced by the genomics consortium of the [African Cassava Whitefly Project](http://www.cassavawhitefly.org), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant Number OPP1058938). 

A field-collected colony (Kayingo, Uganda) was established, maintained and inbred (F6 generation) by [Dr Habibu Mugerwa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=srDeBUgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the quarantine insectary facilities of the [Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom](https://www.nri.org/). 

High-molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from a pooled sample of F6 inbred haploid male individuals (n=3000). PacBio Sequel library construction and sequencing (11 SMRT cells) were performed by the [Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/) (Norwich, United Kingdom).

The current assembly of the *B. tabaci* SSA1-SG1 Uganda genome was generated by [Dr Lahcen Campbell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zZ14f3EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). Genomic assembly was performed with Canu v1.8. The length of *B. tabaci* SSA1-SG1 Uganda genome assembly was 657.7 Mb, housed in 955 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 2.83 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.06 Mb. Total coverage with assembly input PacBio long reads was ~164X. The proportion of assembly gaps or N's was 0.50% while GC content came to 39.3%. Repeat content covered 37.7% of the genome, predominantly of transposable elements without complete classification. Of the identifiable transposable elements (TE), DNA type TE were the most widespread at 4% total coverage.
