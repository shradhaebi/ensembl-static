**Assembly**
------------------------
The *Bemisia tabaci* Uganda 1 genome was produced by the genomics consortium of the [African Cassava Whitefly Project](http://www.cassavawhitefly.org), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant Number OPP1058938). 

A field-collected colony (Namulonge, Uganda) was established, maintained and inbred (F6 generation) by [Dr Habibu Mugerwa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=srDeBUgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the quarantine insectary facilities of the [Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom](https://www.nri.org/). 

High-molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from a pooled sample of F6 inbred haploid male individuals (n=3000). PacBio Sequel library construction and sequencing (7 SMRT cells) were performed by the [Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/) (Norwich, United Kingdom).

The current assembly of the *B. tabaci* Uganda 1 genome was generated by [Dr Lahcen Campbell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zZ14f3EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). The length of the *B. tabaci* Uganda 1 genome was 630.4Mb, housed in 5,713 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 177Kb. The assembly was produced using Canu v1.8: unitig read coverage 34.3X on genome size estimate (650Mb). The GC content of the assembly was 38.3%. Repeat content covered 43.9% of the overall genome, predominantly of transposable elements (TE) without complete classification. Of the identified TE, DNA type TE were the most widespread at 5.29% total coverage.
