***Bemisia tabaci* Uganda 1**
------------------------
Whiteflies of the *Bemisia tabaci* (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex are phloem-feeding insects and plant-virus vectors, some of which are widely regarded to be amongst the world’s worst agricultural pests. Outbreaks of *B. tabaci* cause significant crop losses and contribute to global food insecurity.

The whitefly *Bemisia tabaci* Uganda 1, also referred to as *Bemisia* Uganda1, *B. tabaci* Uganda, *B. tabaci* Uganda sweet potato and *B. tabaci* Uganda 8, has been reported from a range of vegetable and weed hosts in Uganda [1-3]. It has not been reported from cassava or in association with cassava disease epidemics [1-4]. The plant hosts this whitefly has been reported from include: *Ipomoea batatas* (sweetpotato), *Solanum lycopersicum* (tomato), *Commelina benghalensis* (wandering Jew), *Leonotis nepetifolia* (lion's ear), *Pavonia urens* (muwugula), *Cleome gynandra* (joobyo), *Vernonia amygdalina* (mululuza) and *Euphorbia heterophylla* (Mexican fire plant) [1-3]. 

Recent phylogenetic analysis, based on partial mitochondrial COI gene sequences, showed that *B. tabaci* Uganda 1 grouped outside of the *B. tabaci* cryptic species complex, basal to the monophyletic group of *B. tabaci* species [1]. Adults of this species, however, are morphologically indistinguishable from other *B. tabaci* species [1]. As well as being phylogenetically distinct from the sub-Saharan African cassava *B. tabaci* species, it is likely that *B. tabaci* Uganda 1 transmit different groups of plant-viruses that constrain sweetpotato production Uganda [5,6].

The genome described here was generated from a Ugandan population of *B. tabaci* Uganda 1, that was inbred in the laboratory to reduce heterozygosity.

**The *Bemisia tabaci* cryptic species complex**
------------------------
Members of the *B. tabaci* species complex cause plant damage by feeding on plant-phloem sap, inducing phytotoxic disorders, depositing honeydew on which sooty moulds develop and by vectoring > 300 plant-virus species in the genera *Begomovirus*, *Carlavirus*, *Crinivirus*, *Ipomovirus*, *Polerovirus* and *Torradovirus* [7,8]. Diseases caused by these viruses often spread rapidly with devastating yield losses of up to 100% [9]. 

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* currently represents a relatively large group (>44) of mostly unresolved cryptic species, as inferred from phylogenetic species delimitation studies [10,11]. These morphologically indistinguishable species differ from one another not only in their genetic relatedness, but also in various biological traits such as plant host-range breadth, fecundity, insecticide resistance, and plant-virus transmission efficiencies.

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* are distributed globally, from tropical to temperate climatic zones and across all continents (except Antarctica) [11]. Most cryptic species in this complex, as currently understood, are geographically restricted, but two of them are highly invasive globally i.e., *B. tabaci* Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1, also referred to as biotype B and *Bemisia argentifolii*) and *B. tabaci* Mediterranean (MED, also referred to as biotype Q) [11]. *Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* live predominantly on herbaceous plant hosts and have been recorded from an exceedingly broad range of host plants (>500 species) [12]. The documented host-plant range of most cryptic species within the complex remains largely incomplete.
