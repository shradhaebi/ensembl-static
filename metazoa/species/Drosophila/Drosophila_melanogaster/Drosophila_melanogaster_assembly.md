Assembly
--------

Ensembl Metazoa uses the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project
([BDGP](http://www.fruitfly.org)) assembly [release
6](http://fb2017_05.flybase.org/static_pages/feature/previous/articles/2014_07/FB2014_04.html)
(July 2014). In contrast to release 5, regions without a chromosome
assignment are stored as distinct scaffolds, rather than on a single
pseudo-chromosome, and heterochromatin regions are incorporated in the
chromosomal arms.
