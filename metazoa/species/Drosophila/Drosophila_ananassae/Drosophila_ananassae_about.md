About *Drosophila ananassae*
----------------------------

*Drosophila ananassae* is a useful model organism for genetic studies
because it is easily cultured in the laboratory, and was one of 12
fruitfly genomes sequenced for a large comparative study \[1\]. Ensembl
Genomes imports data from [FlyBase](https://flybase.org), who also have
more information about the [biology of *Drosophila
ananassae*](https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/reports/FBsp00000052.html), and a
