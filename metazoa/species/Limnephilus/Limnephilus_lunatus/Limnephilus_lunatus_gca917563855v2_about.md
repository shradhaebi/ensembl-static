**About *Limnephilus lunatus***
-------------------------

*Limnephilus* is a genus of caddisflies in the family Limnephilidae.
There are over 180 species of Limnephilus, described between 1824 and
1999.

This genus is most important in lakes, spring ponds, and beaver ponds.
Some of its species do well enough in spring creeks and slow pools to be
important to trout there. Some Limnephilus species are
multibrooded. It is fairly frequent in Leicestershire and Rutland,
and common and widespread over much of Britain.

*Limnephilus lunatus* is a member of the Limnephilidae family of caddisflies with about 100 genera. 
They belong to the main lineage of case-constructing caddisflies, the
Integripalpia or tube-case caddisflies. The Limnephilidae is one of the
most species-rich Trichoptera families of northern temperate regions,
but only a few are known from tropical areas and the Southern
Hemisphere. For this reason they are often known as northern
caddisflies.
