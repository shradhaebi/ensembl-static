**About *Bactrocera dorsalis***
-------------------------
*Bactrocera dorsalis*, previously known as Dacus dorsalis and commonly 
referred to as the oriental fruit fly (*Bactrocera dorsalis*), is a 
species of tephritid fruit fly that is endemic to Southeast Asia. It 
is one of the major pest species in the genus Bactrocera with a broad 
host range of cultivated and wild fruits. Male B. dorsalis respond 
strongly to methyl eugenol, which is used to monitor and estimate 
populations, as well as to annihilate males as a form of pest control. 
They are also important pollinators and visitors of wild orchids, 
Bulbophyllum cheiri and Bulbophyllum vinaceum in Southeast Asia, which 
lure the flies using methyl eugenol.
