About *Giardia intestinalis assemblage B str. BAH15c1* 
------------------------------------------------------



***Giardia lamblia***, also known as ***Giardia intestinalis***, is a
flagellated parasitic microorganism, that colonizes and reproduces in
the small intestine, causing giardiasis. The parasite attaches to the
epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc or sucker, and reproduces via
binary fission. Giardiasis does not spread via the bloodstream, nor does
it spread to other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, but remains
confined to the lumen of the small intestine. *Giardia* trophozoites
absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are
anaerobes. If the organism is split and stained, its characteristic
pattern resembles the familiar \"smiley face\" symbol. Chief pathways of
human infection include ingestion of untreated sewage, a phenomenon
particularly common in many developing countries; contamination of
natural waters also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs.
Giardia infections occur worldwide, however *Giardia lamblia* is the
most commonly identified intestinal parasite in the United States and
Canada among children in day care centers, hikers, family members and
immunocompromised adults. Approximately 20,000 cases per year in the
United States are reported.
