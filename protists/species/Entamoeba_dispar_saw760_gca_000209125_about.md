About *Entamoeba dispar SAW760* 
-------------------------------



***Entamoeba*** is a genus of Amoebozoa found as internal parasites or
commensals of animals.

In 1875, Fedor Lösch described the first proven case of amoebic
dysentery in St. Petersburg, Russia. He referred to the amoeba he
observed microscopically as *Amoeba coli*; however, it is not clear
whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a
formal taxonomic name. The genus *Entamoeba* was defined by Casagrandi
and Barbagallo for the species *Entamoeba coli*, which is known to be a
commensal organism. Lösch\'s organism was renamed *Entamoeba
histolytica* by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a
self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. For a time during
the first half of the 20th century the entire genus *Entamoeba* was
transferred to *Endamoeba*, a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates
about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International
Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and *Entamoeba*
has stayed \'stable\' ever since.
