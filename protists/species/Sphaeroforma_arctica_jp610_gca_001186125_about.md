About *Sphaeroforma arctica JP610* 
----------------------------------



***Sphaeroforma arctica***, is a unicellular eukaryote with a pivotal
position in the tree of life. It was first isolated from the arctic
marine amphipod *Gammarus setosus*. Like other Ichthyosporeans such as
*Creolimax* and *Abeoforma*, *Sphaeroforma arctica* are spherical cells
characterized with their capacity to grow into multi-nucleated
coenocytes (multi-nucleates cell). However, a unique feature of
*S. arctica*, is that no obvious budding, hyphal, amoeboid, sporal or
flagellated growth stages have been observed in laboratory growth
conditions.
