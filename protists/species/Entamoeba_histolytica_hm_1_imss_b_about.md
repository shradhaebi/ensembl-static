thumb\|right\|450px\|Life-cycle of *Entamoeba histolytica*

***Entamoeba histolytica*** is an anaerobic parasitic protozoan, part of
the genus *Entamoeba*. Predominantly infecting humans and other
primates, *E. histolytica* is estimated to infect about 50 million
people worldwide. Previously, it was thought that 10% of the world
population was infected, but these figures predate the recognition that
at least 90% of these infections were due to a second species, *E.
dispar*. Mammals such as dogs and cats can become infected transiently,
but are not thought to contribute significantly to transmission.

The word *histolytic* literally means \"Tissue destroyer\"
