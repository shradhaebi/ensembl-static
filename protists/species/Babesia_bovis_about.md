***Babesia bovis*** is a single-celled protozoan parasite of cattle
which occasionally infects humans. It is a member of the phylum
Apicomplexa, which also includes the malaria parasite. The disease it
and other members of the genus *Babesia* cause is a hemolytic anemia
known as babesiosis and colloquially called Texas cattle fever, redwater
or piroplasmosis. It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks
of the order Ixodida. It was eradicated from the United States by 1943,
but is still present in Mexico and much of the world\'s tropics. The
chief vector of *Babesia* species is the southern cattle fever tick
*Rhipicephalus microplus* (formerly *Boophilus microplus*).

In 2007, the sequence of its genome was announced. Measuring 8.2 million
base pairs, its genome is remarkably similar to the genome of *Theileria
parva*, the cause of East Coast fever (theileriosis) in cattle.
