Stem rust, also known as cereal rust, black rust, red rust or red dust, is
caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis, which causes significant disease in
cereal crops. Crop species that are affected by the disease include bread wheat,
durum wheat, barley and triticale. These diseases have affected cereal farming
throughout history. The annual recurrence of stem rust of wheat in North Indian
plains was discovered by Prof. K.C. Mehta.
An outbreak of another virulent race of stem rust, TTTTF, took place in Sicily
in 2016, suggesting that the disease is returning to Europe. Comprehensive
genomic analysis of Puccinia graminis, combined with plant pathology and climate
data, has pointed out the potential of the re-emergence of stem wheat rust in
UK.
