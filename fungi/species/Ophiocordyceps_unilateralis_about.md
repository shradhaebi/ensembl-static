***Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*** is an entomopathogen, or
insect-pathogenising fungus, discovered by the British naturalist Alfred
Russel Wallace in 1859, and currently found predominantly in tropical
forest ecosystems. *O. unilateralis*, also referred to as a *zombie
fungus*, infects ants of the Camponotini tribe, with the full
pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral
patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests
and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and
humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to
affix themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the
host remains until its eventual death. The process leading to mortality
takes 4--10 days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting
bodies grow from the ant\'s head, rupturing to release the fungus\'s
spores. *O. unilateralis* is in turn also susceptible to fungal
infection itself, an occurrence which can limit its impact on ant
populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.

*O. unilateralis* and related species are known to engage in an active
secondary metabolism, among other reasons, for the production of
substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host
ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction.
Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has
been taken by natural products chemists, with corresponding discovery of
small molecule agents (e.g. of the polyketide family) of potential
interest for use as human immunomodulatory, antiinfective, and
anticancer agents.
