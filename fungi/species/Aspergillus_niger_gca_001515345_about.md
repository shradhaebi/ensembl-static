About *Aspergillus niger (GCA\_001515345)* 
------------------------------------------



***Aspergillus niger*** is a fungus and one of the most common species
of the genus *Aspergillus*.

It causes a disease called **black mould** on certain fruits and
vegetables such as grapes, apricots, onions, and peanuts, and is a
common contaminant of food. It is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly
reported from indoor environments, where its black colonies can be
confused with those of *Stachybotrys* (species of which have also been
called \"black mould\"). It also produces the isoflavone orobol.
