About *Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015* 
-----------------------------------



***Aspergillus niger*** or ***A. niger*** is a fungus and one of the
most common species of the genus *Aspergillus*.

It causes a disease called **black mould** on certain fruits and
vegetables such as grapes, apricots, onions, and peanuts, and is a
common contaminant of food. It is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly
reported from indoor environments, where its black colonies can be
confused with those of *Stachybotrys* (species of which have also been
called \"black mould\"). It also produces the isoflavone orobol.
