About the *Verticillium dahliae* genome
---------------------------------------

*Verticillium dahliae* is one of the causal agent of vascular wilt in
numerous economically important plants causing wilting of all or only
parts of the host. The most common hosts are trees and shrubs, including
olive and maple, and vegetables, including cotton, tomatoes and potatoes
and also ornamentals. This soilborn fungus persists in the soil for many
years under the form of tiny and black resting bodies called
microsclerotia. These germinate in the presence of the host plant roots
when the external conditions are beneficial. The resulting hyphae
invades the plant roots into the the vascular tissue.
