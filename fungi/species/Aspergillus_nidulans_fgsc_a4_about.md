***Aspergillus nidulans*** (also called ***Emericella nidulans*** when
referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph) is one of many species of
filamentous fungi in the phylum Ascomycota. It has been an important
research organism for studying eukaryotic cell biology for over 50
years, being used to study a wide range of subjects including
recombination, DNA repair, mutation, cell cycle control, tubulin,
chromatin, nucleokinesis, pathogenesis, metabolism, and experimental
evolution. It is one of the few species in its genus able to form sexual
spores through meiosis, allowing crossing of strains in the laboratory.
*A. nidulans* is a homothallic fungus, meaning it is able to
self-fertilize and form fruiting bodies in the absence of a mating
partner. It has septate hyphae with a woolly colony texture and white
mycelia. The green colour of wild-type colonies is due to pigmentation
of the spores, while mutations in the pigmentation pathway can produce
other spore colours.
