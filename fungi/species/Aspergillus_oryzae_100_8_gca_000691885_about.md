About *Aspergillus oryzae 100-8 (GCA\_000691885)* 
-------------------------------------------------



***Aspergillus oryzae***, known in English as , is a filamentous fungus
(a mold) used in Chinese and other East Asian cuisines to ferment
soybeans for making soy sauce and fermented bean paste, and also to
saccharify rice, other grains, and potatoes in the making of alcoholic
beverages such as *huangjiu*, *sake*, *makgeolli*, and *shōchū*. The
domestication of *A. oryzae* occurred at least 2000 years ago. *A.
oryzae* is also used for the production of rice vinegars.

Eiji Ichishima of Tohoku University called the *kōji* fungus a
\"national fungus\" (*kokkin*) in the journal of the Brewing Society of
Japan, because of its importance not only for making the *koji* for
*sake* brewing, but also for making the *koji* for *miso*, soy sauce,
and a range of other traditional Japanese foods. His proposal was
approved at the society\'s annual meeting in 2006, despite the fact that
it is not of Japanese origin nor is it used exclusively by Japan, having
been imported from China.

\"Red *kōji-kin*\" is a separate species, *Monascus purpureus*.
