***Piriformospora*** is a fungal genus of the order Sebacinales. It is a
monotypic genus, containing the single endophytic root-colonising
species ***Piriformospora indica***, discovered from orchid plants in
the Thar desert in Rajasthan, India by Prof. Ajit Verma and group,
School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. The
fungus has typical pear-shaped chlamydospores, and thus, named as
*P. indica* . Unlike mycorrhizal fungi, which cannot be cultured
axenically, *P. indica* can be easily grown on various substrates. It
has been found to promote plant growth during its mutualistic symbiotic
relationship with a wide variety of plants. Experiments have shown that
*P. indica* increases the resistance of colonized plants against fungal
pathogens. It has also been found in experiments with barley that
*P. indica*-inoculated plants are tolerant to salt stress and more
resistant to root pathogens. *P. indica*-infested roots also show
antioxidant capacity. The fungus also induces systemic disease
resistance in plants. *P. indica* was found to require host cell death
for proliferation during mutualistic symbiosis in barley. Its genome has
been sequenced and was published in 2011.
