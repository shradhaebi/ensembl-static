About *Saccharomyces cerevisiae YJM1356* 
----------------------------------------



***Saccharomyces cerevisiae*** is a species of yeast. It is perhaps the
most useful yeast, having been instrumental to winemaking, baking, and
brewing since ancient times. It is believed to have been originally
isolated from the skin of grapes (one can see the yeast as a component
of the thin white film on the skins of some dark-color fruits such as
plums; it exists among the waxes of the cuticle). It is one of the most
intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell
biology, much like *Escherichia coli* as the model bacterium. It is the
microorganism behind the most common type of fermentation.
*S. cerevisiae* cells are round to ovoid, 5--10 μm in diameter. It
reproduces by a division process known as budding.

Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by
studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle
proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. *S.
cerevisiae* is currently the only yeast cell known to have Berkeley
bodies present, which are involved in particular secretory pathways.
Antibodies against *S. cerevisiae* are found in 60--70% of patients with
Crohn\'s disease and 10--15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (and 8%
of healthy controls).
