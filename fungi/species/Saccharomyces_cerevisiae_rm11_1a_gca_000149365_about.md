***Saccharomyces cerevisiae*** () is a species of yeast. It has been
instrumental to winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. It
is believed to have been originally isolated from the skin of grapes
(one can see the yeast as a component of the thin white film on the
skins of some dark-colored fruits such as plums; it exists among the
waxes of the cuticle). It is one of the most intensively studied
eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like
*Escherichia coli* as the model bacterium. It is the microorganism
behind the most common type of fermentation. *S. cerevisiae* cells are
round to ovoid, 5--10 μm in diameter. It reproduces by a division
process known as budding.

Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by
studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle
proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. *S.
cerevisiae* is currently the only yeast cell known to have Berkeley
bodies present, which are involved in particular secretory pathways.
Antibodies against *S. cerevisiae* are found in 60--70% of patients with
Crohn\'s disease and 10--15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (and 8%
of healthy controls).
