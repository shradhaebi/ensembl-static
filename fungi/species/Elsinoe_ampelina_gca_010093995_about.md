Elsinoë ampelina is a plant pathogen, which is the causal agent of anthracnose
on grape.
This type of anthracnose affects several plant varieties, including some
brambles and wine grapes. Grape anthracnose can be identified by the "bird's
eye" lesions on the berries and sunken black or greyish lesions on leaves and
shoots. From these lesions, conidia are produced.  This disease can be lethal to
the plant, either through defoliation and removal of photosynthetic capacity, or
through injury to the active regions of the vine. Grape anthracnose is
particularly important to the wine industry, as it can decrease quality and
quantity of berries produced as well as kill the vine outright, leading to large
economic losses, in particular during the middle summer months.
