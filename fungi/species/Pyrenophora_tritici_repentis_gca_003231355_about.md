Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (telomorph) and Drechslera tritici-repentis
(anamorph) is a necrotrophic plant pathogen of fungal origin, phylum Ascomycota.
P. tritici-repentis overwinters on stubble, and due to recent heavily
no-till/residue retention cultural practices, increased incidence and yield loss
of up to 49% has been witnessed if ideal conditions occur. It forms
characteristic, dark, oval-shaped spots of necrotic tissue surrounded by a
yellow ring. It is responsible for losses that account for up to 30% of the
crop, due to its effects reducing photosynthesis. Pathogenesis and toxicity in
P. tritici-repentis is controlled by a single gene, transformations of this gene
cause the pathogen to become benign when interacting with wheat. This has major
implications for those in agriculture seeking to combat the effects of this
fungus.
