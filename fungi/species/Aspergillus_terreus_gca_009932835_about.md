Aspergillus terreus, also known as Aspergillus terrestris, is a fungus (mold)
found worldwide in soil. Although thought to be strictly asexual until recently,
A. terreus is now known to be capable of sexual reproduction.  It was also the
initial source for the drug mevinolin (lovastatin), a drug for lowering serum
cholesterol.
Aspergillus terreus can cause opportunistic infection in people with deficient
immune systems. It is relatively resistant to amphotericin B, a common
antifungal drug.  Aspergillus terreus also produces aspterric acid and
6-hydroxymellein, inhibitors of pollen development in Arabidopsis thaliana.
